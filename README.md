This repository contains the solution from my YouTube video showing how to build an accessible debounce filter component.

**Note:** Added a clear text value after uploading to Github and making the video. When using TextDebounce in data tables and grids, you can
use @ref to get a reference to the component and call ClearTextValue to have the value and any associated aria-invalid attribute cleared. Useful when
you are getting/refreshing the grid data as the filter would need clearing as well.
